            <a href="https://cloudflare.com"><button>Cloudflare</button></a>
            <p>Ever wanted to host your own website? Cloudflare is the place for you! From free pages.dev subdomains, hosting, as well as allowing any domains you already own to be used and set for your websites! Plus, you can set up cool emails like mine! nah@nahimkiddinglmao.cf</p>
            <br>
            <a href="https://github.com"><button>GitHub</button></a>
            <p>Kind of like Cloudflare, but not specifically for web hosting! You can create programs in languages such as python, c+ and many more!</p>
